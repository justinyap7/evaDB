# Story Question and Answering
This example demonstrates the capability of EvaDB in extracting embedding from texts, building similarity index, searching similar sources, and using **local LLM** to answer question based on that. For this example, we use "War and Peace" story as the source for our demonstration purpose.

This app is powered by EvaDB and GPT4All. No OpenAI API Key is necessary.

## Setup
Ensure that the local Python version is >= 3.8. Install the required libraries:

```bat
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Run
```bash
python evadb_qa.py
```
